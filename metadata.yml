Title: Penetration in gram-negative bacteria
Description: The model uses the data used to create the Entry rules (Richter et 
  al, 2017) to predict the probability that a molecule permeates across 
  gram-negative membranes. The classifier has been trained using the 
  classification from the original publication into Accumulation class High 
  (Active, or 1) and Low (Inactive, or 0). After cleaning and combining the 
  different datasets, we have 280 molecules of which 107 are labelled as high 
  accumulators in E.coli.
