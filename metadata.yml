Title: Penetration in gram-negative bacteria
Description: The model uses the data used to create the Entry rules (Richter et al,
  2017) to predict the probability that a molecule permeates across gram-negative
  membranes. The classifier has been trained using the classification from the original
  publication into Accumulation class High (Active, or 1) and Low (Inactive, or 0).
  After cleaning and combining the different datasets, we have 280 molecules of which
  107 are labelled as high accumulators in E.coli.
